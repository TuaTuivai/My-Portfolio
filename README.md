# Portfolio

## Description
Module 20 challenge involves creating an updated portfolio that showcases my full-stack development projects. The portfolio includes six different projects, an "about me" section, and a feature that allows users to download my resume.

By completing this challenge, I will be able to demonstrate my full-stack development skills and showcase my portfolio to potential employers and clients. I will also have the opportunity to reflect on my past projects and improve my portfolio with each new project that I complete.
